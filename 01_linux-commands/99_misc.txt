# search across multiple files easily with grep
# This searches recursively in all .txt files under the #folder. 
# If you prefix your commands with # Command:, 
# itâ€™s even easier to filter specific blocks.

# Command: grep
# -e: 
grep -rnw ./linux-commands/ -e "chmod"


# or get fancy with find + grep:
# Command: find
find . -name "*.txt" -exec grep -H "chmod" {} \;

# Command: find
# locate server module inside python3.x installation path
find /usr/lib/python3.11/ -name server.py
