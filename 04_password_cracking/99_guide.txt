1) Use cewl to generate a custom password.list (OSINT)
  We have Max's wordlist on the exercise
2) Use a hashcat to generate a custom mutated password list (best64.rule or custom.rule) /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
  We did it: we have mut.list
3) Apply the mask attact using mut_password.list 
  And now we use the mut.list with the mask (mask is the 12digit password format that we know from the exercise
    6 = Hybrid Wordlist + Mask
